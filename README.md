# TK8 CLi example Addon for developer

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you all information you need to create your own tk8 addons on top of your kubernetes cluster

### Prerequisites

This addon was created for the tk8 cli you could find it here: https://github.com/kubernauts/tk8
Addon integration is supported on Version 0.5.0 and greater

Alternative you can apply the main.yml directly with kubectl

## Development

Create your own addons for TK8 is easy as well.

```bash
./tk* addon create my-addon
```

Then you can provide the main.yml with your addon components.
Also it is possible to add a main.sh file which runs before the main.yml is applied to the cluster. So you can do some more stuff or generate a main.yml from subfolder yaml files.
